## Overview

This project was originally developed for a client to improve **payment collection visibility across multiple resorts**. For public portfolio use, **all confidential client data has been removed** and replaced with sanitized sample data.

Before this solution, payment tracking relied on **separate resort files and manual consolidation**, making it difficult to:
- Maintain an accurate overview of payment status
- Track deposits vs full payments
- Identify top revenue-contributing countries
- Update reports efficiently on a daily basis

This Excel dashboard centralizes all resort data into **one automated, decision-ready view**, reducing manual work and improving reporting clarity.
