## Overview

This project was originally developed for a client to streamline payment tracking across multiple resorts. To make it available for public use, **all confidential data have been removed**, and sample data has been included in the dashboard.

Managing resort payments manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when handling multiple resorts, payment types, and daily updates. This Excel dashboard provides a **dynamic, consolidated solution** that saves time and improves visibility.
