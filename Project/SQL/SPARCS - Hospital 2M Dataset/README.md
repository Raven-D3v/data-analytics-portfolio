![Hospital Dashboard V2](SPARCS-Hospital1.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the **New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS)** dataset, containing over **2 million hospital inpatient discharge records**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of **SQL queries** for analyzing large-scale healthcare data, focusing on patient demographics, insurance distribution, hospital efficiency, and department-level insights.

## ⚙️ Tools & Environment

* **Google Colab**: Used because the dataset is too large to process on a local machine. Running queries in Colab provides better scalability and ensures reproducibility.
* **DuckDB:** Chosen because it fits seamlessly with the Python environment of Google Colab, allowing efficient SQL queries directly on large datasets without needing a full database server.
* **Pandas**: For additional data manipulation.

## 📊 Key Analyses

* Hospital Efficiency KPIs
* Revenue & Cost Insights
* Patient Demographic Patterns

## 📂 Dataset

**New York State Department of Health – SPARCS Hospital Inpatient Discharges (De-Identified)**.
