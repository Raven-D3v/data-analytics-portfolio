## 📌 Overview

🔹 This project analyzes the **2022 Philippine Presidential Election** using **Tableau Public**.  
🔹 Focused on **interactive data exploration** — users can **filter by province and region**, view **vote shares**, and **identify top candidates**.  
🔹 Built with a clean design to support **data storytelling**, interactivity, and user insight.  
🔹 Used real election data from an open dataset hosted on **Figshare**, consisting of **105,972 rows** of datas.  
🔹 Developed as a learning project to apply **Level of Detail (LOD) calculations**, **dynamic filters**, and **non-pivot comparisons** in Tableau.

### **Project Goal:**

📊 Build a fully **interactive Tableau dashboard** that enables users to:  
- Identify top-performing candidates by region  
- Compare candidate votes side-by-side  
- Select any president and instantly update the views

### **Tools Used:**

🛠 **Tableau Public**  
- Level of Detail (LOD) Calculations  
- Interactive Filters  
- Dual Data Sources (non-pivot & pivot)  
- Custom Calculated Fields
